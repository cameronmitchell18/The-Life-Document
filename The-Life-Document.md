# Cameron's Life Document
---

## *About*

This document is inspired by [Merlin Mann](https://hotdogsladies.omg.lol/) and his [Wisdom Document](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md). I wanted to create this document to write down some of my favorite quotes, give some life advice (that works for me), and talk about some of my favorite things. I hope to be able to commit some of my time each day to either list or write down one thing in this document. If I am able to commit the time and energy, I want to share this with my son someday so he can look back to see who his dad was before he came into my life.

# Cameron's Life Document


## **About**

This document is inspired by [Merlin Mann](https://hotdogsladies.omg.lol/) and his [Wisdom Document](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md). I wanted to create this document to write down some of my favorite quotes, give some life advice (that works for me), and talk about some of my favorite things. I hope to be able to commit some of my time each day to either list or write down one thing in this document. If I am able to commit the time and energy, I want to share this with my son someday so he can look back to see who his dad was before he came into my life. 

## Things About Life I Believe
- If you're going to do something, you may as well work hard at it and give it your best effort.
- Working is not a burden, it is a gift. 
- Doing things that are hard is good for the mind, body, and soul. 
- A good dog will bring you some of the biggest smiles but also, some of the greatest hurt.
